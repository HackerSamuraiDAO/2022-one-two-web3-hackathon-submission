## Why we build this project
Our goal is the users can manage their NFT data in a decentralized way

Currently, a plenty of NFT tool or market places are flooded and many of them provided the NFT minting function. Some managed the users NFT metadata in a decentralized way but some are not. Since the decentralized nature of NFT data management is also a hot topic these days, some protocols have a function to immigrate the NFT data from a centralized management to decentralized but each protocols have own procees so that it is still difficult for the users to do it.

We would like to solve these problem and realize what we aim by providing the interface to immigrate their NFT metadata to a decentralized management according to each protocol's NFT contract, and make it commonplace for creators to be able to manage NFT data themselves.
